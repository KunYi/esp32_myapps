# ESP32 Applications Collection

This repository contains my personal collection of ESP32 applications and test projects. These applications are developed using both ESP-IDF framework and Arduino framework.

## Projects

### `w2812/`
- WS2812 LED control application

### `ethernet/`
- W32-ETH01 Ethernet test application
- Tests LAN8720 Ethernet PHY functionality
- Based on ESP-IDF ethernet example

### `duino_ethernet/`
- Arduino version of W32-ETH01 Ethernet test
- Same hardware configuration as ESP-IDF version
- Simplified implementation using Arduino framework
- Stable Ethernet connectivity with LAN8720

## Development Frameworks

The applications in this repository are developed using:

- ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
- Arduino Framework for ESP32

## Usage

Each subdirectory is a standalone application with its own documentation and configuration. Please refer to the specific instructions in each project directory for running and using these applications.

## License

Each project has its own license. Please refer to the LICENSE file in each project directory for specific licensing information.

## Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome to improve these applications.

## Important Notes

- Some applications may require specific hardware configurations
- Make sure you use the correct framework version and development environment
- Read the relevant documentation carefully before running applications

## Contact

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me through GitHub Issues.
